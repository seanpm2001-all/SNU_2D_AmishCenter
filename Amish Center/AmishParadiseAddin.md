## Why I can't add this video file in yet

This directory is incomplete without the video file of the Amish Paradise music video by Weird Al. I can't upload it due to copyright issues/no permission from Weird Al.

For now, just ignore the empty video slot, or go ahead and rip the video yourself at your own risk. My suggestions for a video downloader would be:

> * VLC Media Player (copy the network link (the URL of the video) example: `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ` into the player, load the video in VLC, go to `Tools/Media Information/Metadata` load the metadata, copy the Google Server location link and paste it into a browser, then right click the video and then click `Save as` VLC stops letting you do it if you do it too frequently, it might only be on my end though, I have broken 2 VLC installations on 2 different laptops doing this)

> * VideoDownloadHelper (A Firefox/Chrome browser extension) - it has a $27.00 registration cost if you want to download videos without aggregation (Raises your CPU usage up significantly (normally to 90-100%) for several minutes to add a QR code) but you can literally just use the `Hit` menu, and get the source of the video and audio directly from Google's servers. For some videos, the tracks are separate, for some, it is all-in-one. If you get 2 tracks, just combine the audio track into the video track with video editing software.
